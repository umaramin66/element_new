<b>About this credit Guide</b><br><br>
This Credit Guide contains important information about us, the services we provide and the activities of<br>
the credit representative operating under our credit licence. It also contains:<br>
 - Information about fees and charges that may be payable by you to us<br>
 - Commissions that we may receive when we are acting as a credit representative<br>
 - Commissions that we may pay to third parties for introduction of business, and information about<br>
what you should do if you have a complaint or dispute regarding our services and activities.<br>
We are required to provide this document to you as soon as practicable after it becomes apparent that we<br>
are likely to provide credit assistance to you. We provide “credit assistance” when we:<br>
1. Suggest or assist you in applying for:<br>
a. a particular loan with a particular lender<br>
b. an increase to an existing loan with a particular lender, or<br>
2. Recommend that you remain in an existing loan contract.<br><br>
<b>Preliminary Assessment</b><br><br>
Prior to providing credit assistance to you, we must assess whether the particular loan is “unsuitable”. A loan<br>
will be “unsuitable” based on the infomation you provide to us.<br>
You can request a copy of our preliminary assessment. We must give you a written copy of the preliminary<br>
assessment (free of charge):<br>
- Within 7 business days, if your request is made within 2years of the date we give you a credit assistance<br>
quote under section 114 of the national consumer credit protection Act 2009; and<br>
- Otherwise, within 21 business days.<br><br>
We do not need to give you a copy of the preliminary assessment if:<br>
- your request is made more than 7 years after the date we give you a credit assistance quote: or<br>
- we do not provide any credit assistance to you.<br>
Fees and charges that are payable by you in relations toour credit assistance<br>
We may charge a fee for providing credit assistance to you. If applicable, details about those fees payable<br>
by you will be set out in a Credit Quote which we will give you prior to submitting your asset finance<br>
application.<br><br>
<b>Other fees and charges</b><br><br>
	You may have to pay other fees and charges (such as application fees, valuation costs and other<br>
applicable fees) to the lender or other parties. You should review the particular asset finance contract<br>
documentation for further details of any such fees and charges.<br><br>
<b>How i get paid?</b><br><br>
We only receive a commission if your asset finance facility is settled. The commission is paid to us either<br>
directly by the lenders, or paid to us by our aggregator for which we act as the credit representative in<br>
providing credit assistance.<br>
The commission is based on both the total amount financed and the particular loan product you have<br>
selected. We may receive the following commissions after your loan has settled.<br>
Type of Commission:<br>
Credit Guide – Connective Credit Services Pty Ltd - Credit Representative «broker_full_name»<br>
Commission ‘Brokerage Fee’(Paid after settlement)<br>
Ranging from a minimum 0% to a maximum of 8% depending on the type of credit<br>
contract and calculated on the total loan amount financed including GST.<br>
Volume Bonus<br>
Ranging from a minimum 0% to a maximum of 1% depending on the type of credit<br>
contract, the total volume of introduced business including GST. Subject to<br>
aggregator and individual credit representative performance benchmarks.<br>
The method of calculation is based on the net amount financed including GST. Details of commission to<br>
be received will be included in the Credit Proposal Disclosure document that we will provide you with<br>
when credit assistance is provided.<br>
From time to time, I may receive a non-commission benefit by way of training, professional development,<br>
entertainment, gift, conference attendance, sponsorship, or entry into a competition run by a lender or my<br>
aggregator, at no extra cost to you. The nature of such arrangements are temporary, and the occurrence<br>
and amounts are often not readily ascertainable, however if they are apparent as a result of assisting you<br>
with credit assistance, this will be disclosed to you. <br><br>
